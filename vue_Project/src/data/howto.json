  "goal": "This tool simplifies your project planning. With the help of the tool, you identify project phases and the tool recommends what skill requirements the project has in each phase.",
  "user": "The tool is intended to support project planning. Therefore, it is recommended to use the tool together.",
  "structure": {
    "Project View": "Each project of your division has its own spreadsheet. Here you can plan the project in detail. The project view includes three parts: First, the project goal and scope are defined. Then, the second part is about defining project phases. In the last part, the skill requirements are identified.",
    "Dashboard": "The information from the project views is collected and consolidated in the dashboard. Here you get an overview of all projects in your division at a glance. The dashboard view can be used for resource coordination between the projects or for communication between project and line operations.",
    "Help Pages": "The How To page explains how the tool is set up. The fill-in help has the project view filled in with the help of an example project, so you can always look here if you have any questions."
  },
  "usage": "Basically, you have to fill in cells with a grey background (exception: Gantt chart in the project view). However, you will receive detailed explanations at the appropriate place.",
  "suitability": "The tool is particularly suitable for waterfall projects, where project phases can be clearly defined. If you have an agile project, you can still use the skills module. Then simply fill out the questions in the project view (step 3) for your entire project and not for the individual phase."
